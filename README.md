Homework assignement for Appsilon.

## Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MehdiChelh/appsilon.ships")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(appsilon.ships)
run_app()
```

## Notes

Currently the dataset is in the package, which is not recommended
regarding the initial size of the data (\~ 400 MB). This is mainly why
the R-CMD check is failing.

However, since this is a homework assignment, Iâ€™m keeping it that way to
facilitate reproducibility.
